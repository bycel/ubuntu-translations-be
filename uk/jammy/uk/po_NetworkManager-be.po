This property allows to specify that certain bits are fixed. Note that the least significant bit of the first MAC address will always be unset to create a unicast MAC address. If the property is NULL, it is eligible to be overwritten by a default connection setting. If the value is still NULL or an empty string, the default is to create a locally-administered, unicast MAC address. If the value contains one MAC address, this address is used as mask. The set bits of the mask are to be filled with the current MAC address of the device, while the unset bits are subject to randomization. Setting \"FE:FF:FF:00:00:00\" means to preserve the OUI of the current MAC address and only randomize the lower 3 bytes using the \"random\" or \"stable\" algorithm. If the value contains one additional MAC address after the mask, this address is used instead of the current MAC address to fill the bits that shall not be randomized. For example, a value of \"FE:FF:FF:00:00:00 68:F7:28:00:00:00\" will set the OUI of the MAC address to 68:F7:28, while the lower bits are randomized.

For example, \"02:00:00:00:00:00 00:00:00:00:00:00 02:00:00:00:00:00\" will create a fully scrambled MAC address, randomly locally or globally administered."

Also, the stable-id can contain placeholders that are substituted dynamically and deterministically depending on the context. The stable-id is used for generating IPv6 stable private addresses with ipv6.addr-gen-mode=stable-privacy. It is also used to seed the generated cloned MAC address for ethernet.cloned-mac-address=stable and wifi.cloned-mac-address=stable. It is also used as DHCP client identifier with ipv4.dhcp-client-id=stable and to derive the DHCP DUID with ipv6.dhcp-duid=stable-[llt,ll,uuid]. Note that depending on the context where it is used, other parameters are also seeded into the generation algorithm. For example, a per-host key is commonly also included, so that different systems end up generating different IDs. Or with ipv6.addr-gen-mode=stable-privacy, also the device's name is included, so that different interfaces yield different addresses. The per-host key is the identity of your machine and stored in /var/lib/NetworkManager/secret-key. The '$' character is treated special to perform dynamic substitutions at runtime. Currently, supported are \"${CONNECTION}\", \"${DEVICE}\", \"${MAC}\", \"${BOOT}\", \"${RANDOM}\". These effectively create unique IDs per-connection, per-device, per-boot, or every time. Note that \"${DEVICE}\" corresponds to the interface name of the device and \"${MAC}\" is the permanent MAC address of the device. Any unrecognized patterns following '$' are treated verbatim, however are reserved for future use. You are thus advised to avoid '$' or escape it as \"$$\". For example, set it to \"${CONNECTION}-${BOOT}-${DEVICE}\" to create a unique id for this connection that changes with every reboot and differs depending on the interface where the profile activates.

msgid "DNS servers priority. The relative priority for DNS servers specified by this setting.  A lower numerical value is better (higher priority). Negative values have the special effect of excluding other configurations with a greater numerical priority value; so in presence of at least one negative priority, only DNS servers from connections with the lowest priority value will be used. To avoid all DNS leaks, set the priority of the profile that should be used to the most negative value of all active connections profiles. Zero selects a globally configured default value. If the latter is missing or zero too, it defaults to 50 for VPNs (including WireGuard) and 100 for other connections. Note that the priority is to order DNS settings for multiple active connections.  It does not disambiguate multiple DNS servers within the same connection profile. When multiple devices have configurations with the same priority, VPNs will be considered first, then devices with the best (lowest metric) default route and then all other devices. When using dns=default, servers with higher priority will be on top of resolv.conf. To prioritize a given server over another one within the same connection, just specify them in the desired order. Note that commonly the resolver tries name servers in /etc/resolv.conf in the order listed, proceeding with the next server in the list on failure. See for example the \"rotate\" option of the dns-options setting. If there are any negative DNS priorities, then only name servers from the devices with that lowest priority will be considered. When using a DNS resolver that supports Conditional Forwarding or Split DNS (with dns=dnsmasq or dns=systemd-resolved settings), each connection is used to query domains in its search list. The search domains determine which name servers to ask, and the DNS priority is used to prioritize name servers based on the domain.  Queries for domains not present in any search list are routed through connections having the '~.' special wildcard domain, which is added automatically to connections with the default route (or can be added manually).  When multiple connections specify the same domain, the one with the best priority (lowest numerical value) wins.  If a sub domain is configured on another interface it will be accepted regardless the priority, unless parent domain on the other interface has a negative priority, which causes the sub domain to be shadowed. With Split DNS one can avoid undesired DNS leaks by properly configuring DNS priorities and the search domains, so that only name servers of the desired interface are configured."
