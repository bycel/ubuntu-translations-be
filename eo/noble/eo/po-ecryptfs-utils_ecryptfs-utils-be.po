#. Description
#: ../src/desktop/ecryptfs-record-passphrase:8
msgid "To encrypt your home directory or \"Private\" folder, a strong passphrase has been automatically generated. Usually your directory is unlocked with your user password, but if you ever need to manually recover this directory, you will need this passphrase. Please print or write it down and store it in a safe location. If you click \"Run this action now\", enter your login password at the \"Passphrase\" prompt and you can display your randomly generated passphrase. Otherwise, you will need to run \"ecryptfs-unwrap-passphrase\" from the command line to retrieve and record your generated passphrase."
