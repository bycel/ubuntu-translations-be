msgid ""
"Many providers have routers that do not support TCP packets with a MSS "

"through one real Ethernet link with the default MTU size (1500). "
"Unfortunately, if you are forwarding packets from other hosts (i.e. doing "
"masquerading) the MSS may be increased depending on the packet size and the "
"route to the client hosts, so your client machines won't be able to connect "
"to some sites. There is a solution: the maximum MSS can be limited by pppoe. "
