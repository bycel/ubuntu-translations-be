msgid "Many providers have routers that do not support TCP packets with a MSS higher than 1460. Usually, outgoing packets have this MSS when they go through one real Ethernet link with the default MTU size (1500). Unfortunately, if you are forwarding packets from other hosts (i.e. doing masquerading) the MSS may be increased depending on the packet size and the route to the client hosts, so your client machines won't be able to connect to some sites. There is a solution: the maximum MSS can be limited by pppoe. You can find more details about this issue in the pppoe documentation.\n\n"
